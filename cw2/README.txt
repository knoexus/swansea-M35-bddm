Main notebook for the project: 2023638.ipynb
To run the code please run each cell one by one in a sequential order. 


As for the coursework only one data mining problem had to be solved, we left the remaining algorithms as supplementary.

Supplementary notebooks:

1) Supplementary_Predicting_Seller.ipynb
The purpose of this notebook is to illustrate how real estate agents could be predicted using ANN.
To run the code please run each cell one by one in a sequential order. 

2) Supplementary_Association.ipynb
In this notebook we use a different approach to recommend real estate agents, using Association Rule Mining. To run the code please run each cell one by one in a sequential order.
